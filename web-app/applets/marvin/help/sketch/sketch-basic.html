<H2><a class="anchor" NAME="create-molecule">Create New Molecule</a></H2>
<P>A new, blank molecule is created when you first launch MarvinSketch. You
can immediately begin working with this molecule. A MarvinSketch window can
hold only one molecule at a time, so all work you do within the
canvas is considered part of the same molecule. You can create a new,
blank molecule at any time during your session by choosing 
<B class="buttonName">File &gt; New &gt; Clear Desk</B> from the menu bar. This
will clear the desk and discard any unsaved changes to the molecule you were
previously working with (but you can get it back using the Undo option). </P>
<P>The application allows you to work with
multiple molecules in multiple windows by choosing <B class="buttonName">File
&gt; New &gt; New Window</B>.
</P>
<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><a class="anchor" name="open-molecule">Open an Existing
	    Molecule File</a></H2>
<P>You can open existing molecule files
(from supported <a href="../formats/formats.html">file formats</a>) by
choosing <B class="buttonName">File &gt; Open</B> on the menu bar.
It will load the content of the molecule file into Marvin and discard any
unsaved changes.</P>
<p>Tick the <b>Show preview checkbox</b> to see the contents of the file (molecules,
reactions, queries). A single item is displayed in the preview window,
the text field at the bottom shows the index of the current structure
and the number of structures in the file. When a multiple structure file is selected
(e.g. sdf), the navigation buttons become active. Their functions are: go to first, 
go to previous, go to next, go to last. Note, that this is not the selection which structure
to open, it allows you only to check whether this is the file you would like to open.
</p>

<p>You can also <b class="buttonName">Paste</b> existing structures from other windows to
    the open molecule, as well as Drag&amp;Drop a molecule file into the Marvin
	window. Both actions will add the new structure to the currently open
    molecule without overwriting the content of the canvas.</p>

<H2><a class="anchor" name="save-molecule">Save Molecule</a></H2>

<H3><a class="anchor" name="save2molformat">Save Molecule File</a></H3>
<P>You can save the molecule to any of the supported 
<a href="../formats/formats.html">file formats.</a>
This will allow you to open and work with this molecule later. The
default behavior of the <B class="buttonName">Save</B>
button is to save the molecule to the same file it was opened from,
in the same format. If you want to change the file name or format,
choose <B class="buttonName">Save As</B>.
If you are working with a new molecule, <B class="buttonName">Save</B>
will function the same as <B class="buttonName">Save As</B>. 
</P>
<H3><a class="anchor" name="export-as-image">Save As Image</a></H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0">The <B class="buttonName">Save As Image</B> choice
in the <B class="buttonName">File</B> menu allows you to save an image of the
molecule in the sketcher. Marvin supports the following image
formats: JPEG, PNG, PPM, POVRay, and SVG. Please note that the saved image
cannot be edited in Marvin.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><a class="anchor" name="print">Print</a></H2>
<P>You can print an image of the current molecule by choosing
<B class="buttonName">File &gt; Print</B>. If you print from a single page
document, if the size of your molecule(s) is bigger then the paper size, it will
be shrunken to one page.</P> If you want to print your molecule(s) to multiple
pages, you have to change the document type to Multipage Document in
<B class="buttonName">File &gt; Document Settings...</B>, and arrange the
structures on the pages.


<H2><a class="anchor" name="howto-multipage">How to Work with Multipage Molecular Document</a></H2>
<H3><a class="anchor" name="createandset">How to create a multipage molecular document</a></H3>
Multipage molecular documents help to work with large drawings by dividing them into pages.
You can create a multipage molecular document by choosing 
<B class="buttonName">File &gt; Document Settings...</B>, then checking in the
<B class="buttonName">Multipage document</B> checkbox.<br>

<H3><a class="anchor" name="navigation">How to navigate in multipage molecular documents</a></H3>
<P>
The navigation status bar and the items in the <B class="buttonName">View &gt; Pages</B> menu are
available only if the <B class="buttonName">Multipage document</B> checkbox is set.
The status bar contains information about
the current page number in a text field and the number of all pages on a label.
It also contains a collection of buttons to 
aid your quick navigation in the document. You can go the first, previous, next, and last page
using them. Alternatively, you can go directly to a specific page
by entering a number in the current page field and pressing enter.</P>
<P>All the navigation possibilities: go to first, previous, next, last, specific
pages are available from the <B class="buttonName">View &gt; Pages </B>  menu as
well. In addition, some automatic page zooming functions are also available in this menu, such as:</P>
<ul>
	<li><B class="buttonName">View &gt; Pages &gt; Fit page height</B> adjusts the
height of the current page to the height of the canvas.</li>

</OL>
<H3><a class="anchor" name="templates">Templates</a></H3>
<p>MarvinSketch provides several predefined chemical structures,
called <b>templates</b> or <b>structure templates</b> (e.g., cyclopenthane, cyclohexane, benzene).
They are categorized to template groups like Amino Acids, Polycyclics, etc.<br>
The following template groups are available in MarvinSketch by default:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Generic</li>
    <li>Rings</li>
    <li>Amino Acids</li>
    <li>Bicyclics</li>
    <li>Bridged Polycyclics</li>
    <li>Crown Ethers</li>
    <li>Cycloalkanes</li>
    <li>Hetero Cycles</li>
    <li>Polycyclics</li>
    <li>Configuration1</li>
    <li>My Templates</li>
</ul>
<P>
The templates can be accessed via the <a href="gui/toolbars.html#templates">Advanced Templates Toolbar</a>
or through the <a href="gui/dialogs.html#template_library"><b>Insert &gt; Template Library</b></a> menu.
</P>
<p>Steps of drawing with templates:</p>
<OL>
    <LI>Select a template using the
	Template Library or the Advanced Templates Toolbar area.</LI>
    <li>In case the template structure contains any S-groups, the group(s)
    can be optionally expanded or contracted by pressing the Shift button.</li>
    <LI>Place the template structure by left-clicking on the
	desired location.</LI>
</OL>
<H3><a class="anchor" name="coordination-compounds">Coordination compounds</a></H3>

You can use coordinate bond to represent coordination compounds (ferrocenes, metallocenes).
For example:
<br><img src="sketch-basic_files/coordination1.png" width="175" height="112"> <br>
The coordinate bond type can represent the connection between an atom and a group of atoms.
The coordinate bond has two kinds of appearance according to IUPAC recommendation:
<UL>
<LI>arrow between two atoms,</LI>
<LI>dashed line between an atom and a group of atoms.</LI>
</UL>
To draw a bond between two atoms just choose the coordinate bond from
the bond list and draw the bond by specifying the required direction. To draw a
bond between an atom and a group  of atoms you need to create
a multi-center attachment point to represent the group of atoms.
<h4>To draw a coordinate bond between an atom and a group of atoms</h4>
<OL>
	<LI> Select the atoms to be represented at one end of the coordinate bond by a multi-center.</LI>
	<LI> Choose "Structure/Add/Multi-center" from the main menu or
	"Add/Multi-center" from the contextual menu. A multi-center represented by a "*" will
	be added. If you move the cursor to the multi-center the represented atoms are
	highlighted (blue circle around the atom labels).</LI>
	<LI> Draw a coordinate bond from the multi-center and edit the other end of the bond if required.
	The "*" representing the multi-center disappears after bond drawing.</LI>
	<LI> Repeat steps 2-4 to draw further multi-centers and coordinate bonds if required.</LI>
</OL>


<H3><a class="anchor" name="markush-structures">Markush structures</a></H3>
A Markush structure is a description of compound classes by generic notations.
They are often used for patent claims and for combinatorial libraries.
Link R-groups, link nodes, atom lists, position variation and
 repeating units with repetition ranges are commonly used features in the representation of Markush structures.
<H4>Position variation (Variable point of attachment)</H4>
You can create a variable point of attachment to represent a variable connection point to a group of atoms.
The representation is similar to the above mentioned multi-center bonds.
For example:
<br><img src="sketch-basic_files/markush3.png" width="204" height="143"> <br>
The alternative attachment points are displayed with grey shadow.
If you move the cursor to the center (the bond ending in the ring) the represented atoms are
highlighted (blue circle around the atom labels).
<h4>To draw a position variation</h4>
<OL>
	<LI> Draw the structure that will include the position variation.</LI>
	<LI> Select the alternative connection point atoms.</LI>
	<LI> Choose "Structure/Add/Multi-center" from the main menu or
	"Add/Multi-center" from the contextual menu. A multi-center represented by a "*" will
	be added. If you move the cursor to the multi-center the represented atoms are
	highlighted (blue circle around the atom labels).</LI>
	<LI> Draw a bond from the center and edit the bond if required. The represented atoms
	are displayed with grey shadow after this step. The "*" representing the multi-center
	disappears after bond drawing.</LI>
	<LI> Repeat step 2-4 to draw further variable points if required.</LI>
</OL>
<H4>Frequency variation (repeating unit with repetition ranges)</H4>
A sequence of ranges to specify the repetition can also be used in a special
 group called repeating unit with repetition ranges.  For example:
<br><img src="sketch-basic_files/markush2.png" width="141" height="141"> <br>
Here the repetition range is "3,5-7". The repetition count for the included structure
(enclosed by the brackets) can be: 3,5,6 or 7.
See <a href="sketch-basic.html#repeatingunits">Repeating units with repetition ranges</a>
for further information on drawing this feature.

<h3><a class="anchor" name="flip">Flip a molecule</a></h3>
You might need to flip the whole or parts of the structures. These operations
are located in the <b>Edit &gt; Transform menu</b>. If no selection is made, the operation
will be executed on the whole structure (except for Group Flip). The flip operation is equal 
to a rotation of 180&deg; around a horizontal or vertical axis in the plane of 
the drawing. All flips result in stereocenter retention.

<table><tr><td width="10%">Horizontal flip</td>
    <td><img src="sketch-basic_files/flip_horizontal.png" width="438" height="148" alt="flip_horizontal"/></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Vertical flip</td>
    <td><img src="sketch-basic_files/flip_vertical.png" width="203" height="241" alt="flip_vertical"/></td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Horizontal Flip, Vertical Flip</h4>
   
   <p>Flip a selection: 
   <ol>
       <li>Select part of the structure.</li>
       <li>Right-click on the structure or go to <b>Edit &gt; Transform menu.</b></li>
       <li>Click on the command.</li>
   </ol>
   
   <p>Flip the whole structure without selection:
   <ol>
       <li>Go to the <b>Edit &gt; Transform menu.</b></li> 
       <li>Click on the command.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Note: If no structure is selected, the right-click on the canvas will not offer the
   flip command.
   
<h4>Group Flip</h4>

The Group Flip operation can be executed only on a selected structure connected 
to the rest of the molecule by only one bond (of any type): the selection 
can not be in the 'middle' of a molecule. The selection is not permitted for disjunctive structures either.
 <p>The Group Flip operation rotates the selected group by 180&deg; around an axis 
 set on the bond connecting the selection to the rest of the molecule. Stereocenters 
 in the molecules are retained, the wedge bond styles change to keep the stereo information.
 <table><tr><td width="10%">Group flip</td>
    <td><img src="sketch-basic_files/flip_group.png" width="374" height="221" alt="flip_group"/></td></tr>
    </table>
 <p>
     <ol>
         <li>Select part of the molecule.</li>
         <li>Right-click on the canvas and select <b>Transform &gt; Group Flip</b>; or go to 
         the <b>Edit &gt; Transform menu.</b></li>
         <li>Select <b>Flip &gt; Group.</b></li>
 </ol>

<h3><a class="anchor" name="mirror">Mirror a molecule</a></h3>
Apart from flipping Marvin is able to produce mirror images of the molecules or parts of.
These operations can be found in the <b>Edit &gt; Transform menu</b>. If no selection
is made, the operation will be executed on the whole structure. Stereocenters will be 
inversed. Mirroring horizontally means that the theoretical mirror is vertical and 
placed perpendicular to the canvas (left-to-right mirroring); the vertical
mirroring means the mirror is horizontal and perpendicular to the canvas 
(upside-down mirroring).
<table><tr><td width="10%">Horizontal mirroring</td>
    <td><img src="sketch-basic_files/mirror_horizontal.png" width="269" height="149" alt="mirror_horizontal"/></td></tr>

<H2><a class="anchor" name="reactions">Reactions</a></H2>

<H3><a class="anchor" name="howto-draw.reactions">How to Draw Reactions</a></H3>
<P>You can place a reaction arrow on the canvas at any time, even on
a blank canvas. Only one reaction is allowed per molecule.</P>
<OL>
    <LI>Select the
        <a href="sketch-gui.html#react.button" class="buttonName">React</a>
	button.  You will see the reaction arrow on the tip of the cursor when
        you move the mouse into the canvas area.</LI>
    <LI>Click the location of the tail of
	the arrow.
    <LI>Drag the mouse and release at the location of the head.</LI>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0">Once you have placed a reaction arrow
on the canvas, MarvinSketch considers each part of the molecule in
relation to the reaction.
All parts of the molecule that are before the arrow are considered reactants.
Every molecule after the arrow is a product, and the ones placed along the
arrow are considered agents.
</P>

<H3><a class="anchor" name="howto-map.reactions">How to Map Reactions</a></H3>
<P>The arrow tool provides the easiest manual way to map corresponding reactant
 and product atoms. Select the arrow tool, hold down the left mouse button on a
 reactant atom, and drag it to the corresponding product atom. The same map
number is added to both atoms marking, that they represent the same atom on the
two sides of the reaction scheme. There are also keyboard shortcuts for
mapping. Type m8, for example, and click on an atom. Atom map 8 is assigned to
that atom.</P>
<P> Marvin contains an automapper tool as well (available as
Structure &gt; Reaction &gt; Map Atoms) assigning map numbers to all selected atoms of
a reaction automatically.</P>
<P> Map numbers of the selected atoms can be removed by the
Structure &gt; Reaction &gt; Unmap Atoms menu item, or by typing m0 for the selected

<H2><a class="anchor" name="howto-draw.rgroups">How to Draw R-group queries</a></H2>
<P>An <a HREF="http://www.chemaxon.com/jchem/doc/user/query.html#markush"
>R-group query</a> describes a set of derivatives in one query structure (substitution
variation). It can be drawn the following way: First
draw the root structure and place some R atoms either from the Periodic System dialog window,
from the popup menu or by typing a corresponding label such as "R1" on the
keyboard.
Then draw the variable R-group ligands and select those substituting the R1 atom.
If you type "R1" now, the selected groups will be marked with "R1". Additional
R-group conditions (Occurrence, RestH, If-then) can be set in the R-logic dialog
window available from the <b>Structure &gt; Attributes</b> menu.</P>

<p>To draw the attachment points for the R-definitions, you can use menu
"<i>Group -> Attachment point</i>" from the atom popup menu, or alternatively,
when you draw the R-definitions and the mouse cursor still shows "R1",
clicking on an atom of the definition will toggle the attachment point on that
atom. (Please note that divalent R-groups must have two attachment points
defined.)</p>
<h3>Step by step example</h3>
<ol>
<li>Draw the root structure first.<br>
<img src="sketch-basic_files/r-group-step1.png" width="152" height="98"></li>
<li>Move the cursor to the atom where you would like to place the R-group.
(In this example, we place R-groups in place of the terminal carbon atoms.)
When the atom is highlighted (blue circle around the atom label), type the
shortcut of the required R-group ID (e.g. R1). Alternative solution is
selecting the ID from <em>R-group</em> sub-menu of the popup menu by pressing right
mouse button over the atom.<br>
<img src="sketch-basic_files/r-group-step2.png" width="139" height="95"></li>
<li>Draw an alternative ligand with an R-group connection: Move the cursor to an empty place on the canvas (take care that nothing is selected) then press
the shortcut of the next R-group (R2). The "in hand" object changes to the ID of the R-group (R2). (In this example, we add a ligand to terminal oxygen atom.)
Move the cursor over the atom (the terminal oxygen) where you would like to add the new ligand and push the left mouse button. Then drag the mouse. You will
see that the new bond is displayed and its orientation follows the cursor.
Release the mouse button when the bond stands in the right direction.<br>
<img src="sketch-basic_files/r-group-step3.png" width="155" height="103"></li>
<li>Draw new fragments to the canvas (separately from the root structure), which
will be the R-group definitions. (In this example, we draw the fragments for
the first R-group definition to the right side and the second R-group
    definition will be placed below the root structure.)<br>
<img src="sketch-basic_files/r-group-step4.png" width="286" height="235"></li>
<li>Next, define the R-groups definitions. To do this, select those fragments
that the first R-group should contain (on the right side).
After the selection, press the shortcut of the R-group ID (R1). The ID and equal sign (R1=) will display beside the selected set and the "in hand" object
will be the R-group ID.</li>
<li>Define attachment point to R-group members: Click the left mouse button on
atoms where you would like place the attachment points.
Repeat this operation on the other definitions of the R-group.
(In this example, at the third definition, we select the left oxygen atom
for attachment.) Alternatively, you can define R-group attachment points
via the popup menu (by selecting <em>Attachment point</em> option from the <em>Group</em>
menu on an atom of an R-group definition.<br>
<img src="sketch-basic_files/r-group-step5.png" width="283" height="232"></li>
<li>Create the second R-group by repeating the last two steps on the two
    remaining fragments.<br>
<img src="sketch-basic_files/r-group-step6.png" width="316" height="227"></li>
<li>You can define additional conditions, such as occurrence, rest H and if-then
expressions to R-groups in the R-logic dialog window. To do this,
select menu option <b>Structure &gt; Attributes -&gt; R-logic</b>.
After setting the conditions in the <em>R-logic</em> dialog window, press the
<em>OK</em> button to apply the changes.<br>

<H3><a class="anchor" name="abbreviatedgroups">Abbreviated (superatom) S-groups</a></H3>
Abbreviated S-groups are used to represent a part of a structure with a text abbreviation.
<ul><li><b>Insert an abbreviated group</b> into your sketch: type the name of the abbreviation<!-- 
(see list <a href="abbrevgroup_table.html">here</a>)-->, to complete a longer name, 
press ENTER or END after typing the first few characters. If the cursor was placed 
over an atom, it will be automatically changed to the abbreviated group. If no atom was selected, 
the abbreviation is placed on the cursor. Click on the canvas to place it. If you would 
like to ungroup an S-group before placing it to the canvas, 
press the <i>SHIFT</i> button before you release the mouse on the desired

group. Then select the group, right-click and press Add to My Templates. The template
can be inserted by typing its name and clicking on the canvas.

<h4>Syntax of the abbreviated S-group name</h4>
Numbers are automatically subscripted unless "\n" is used or at the start of string.
Charges (+, -, ++, --, 3+ etc.) are automatically superscripted at end of string
 or if the following character is a closing parenthesis. <br>
Allowed control sequences in the abbreviated S-group name:
<UL>
<LI>\s - subscript </LI>
<LI>\S - superscript </LI>
<LI>\n - normal mode. </LI>

the <b>Create Group</b> dialog window from the Structure &gt; Group submenu.
Here you can specify a positive repeating count depending on how many times you want the structure to be repeated.
You can retrieve the whole structure from the condensed form with the "Expand"
function and shorten the structure with the "Contract" function.
Manipulation with multiple S-groups is possible with "Expand", "Contract",
"Ungroup", and "Remove" from the Group submenu.
For example:

<h3><a class="anchor" name="comBrackets">Components, Unordered Mixtures and Ordered Mixtures</a></h3>

These features can be expressed by brackets (S-groups) of type component,
unordered mixture (also called mixture)
and ordered mixture (also called formulation).
A component here is a set of atoms contained by a component bracket.

<h4>Ordered and unordered mixtures</h4>

An unordered mixture (denoted by "mix" at the bottom of the right bracket)
consists of several unordered components (denoted by "c" at the bottom of the right bracket).
For these types of mixtures, the order of addition during the
preparation  is not important. Example:
<p>
<img src="sketch-basic_files/mix01.png" width="360" height="181">
<p>
Ordered mixtures, on the other hand contain ordered
components, which define the order of addition. Example:

<H3><a class="anchor" name="polymers">Polymers</a></H3>

The polymer structure consists of structural fragments. These fragments are enclosed by polymer
brackets. The meaning of a polymer bracket is that the fragment within the brackets can
repeat with itself. The fragment within the bracket is called repeating unit.
Polymers can be represented as structure-based or source-based polymers depending on how
much structural detail is known.

<H4>Source-based representation of polymers</H4>

You can use the monomer (mon) or mer (mer) repeating unit types to draw a polymer where only the
source-based representation is known. For example:
<p>
<img src="sketch-basic_files/polymer1.png" width="118" height="111">
<p>
To draw a repeating unit select the atoms you want to be included and choose Create Group from Structure menu
or Group/Create Group from contextual menu.

<H4>Structure-based representation of polymers</H4>

You can use the structural repeating unit type (SRU) to draw a polymer where the structure-based
representation is known.
Each SRU S-group has two or more dedicated bonds, called
crossing bonds, which cross the brackets. The crossing bonds of an SRU show
how the repeating units may connect in several ways to each other within the polymer.
Depending on the number of crossing
bonds and brackets we differentiate the following polymers and connectivities within the polymer:
<ul>
<li>Polymers with two crossing bonds.
     If the polymer has one crossing bond on each bracket of the SRU
     there are three possibilities for the repeating pattern:
     <ul>
      <li> head-to-tail </li>
      <li> head-to-head </li>
      <li> either/unknown </li>
     </ul>
<p>
<img src="sketch-basic_files/polymer2.png" width="126" height="83"></li>
<p>
<li>Ladder-Type Polymers.
      Polymers with paired brackets and with two crossing bonds on each bracket are
      called ladder-type polymers. Here it must be specified how the two crossing bonds
      on each bracket connect to the corresponding bonds of the adjoining repeating units.
      Additionally to the head-to-tail, head-to-head connectivity information
      there is flip information to specify whether the repeating unit flips around the polymer
      backbone when it connects to the adjoining SRU.
      These types of information are handled only in case of brackets
      with exactly two crossing bonds on both side (head and tail side).
      We differentiate the following polymer connectivities:
      <ul>
      <li> head-to-tail with no flip
      <li> head-to-tail with flip
      <li> head-to-head with no flip
      <li> head-to-head with flip
      <li> either/unknown
      </ul>
<br>
<img src="sketch-basic_files/polymer3.png" width="134" height="106"></li>
<li>Polymers with three or more brackets.
      If the polymer has three or more bonds with a separated bracket on each bond,
      the polymer always has the either/unknown repeating pattern.
</ul>
The end groups of polymers are often unknown or unspecified which are represented by star atoms (*).
The modified (mod), grafted (grf) and crossliked (xl) form of a structural repeating unit can be drawn as well.

<H4>Copolymers</H4>
If the structure consists of more than one repeating unit (mon, mer) or structural repeating unit,
 Copolymer (co)  brackets/groups can be used to represent the structure. Copolymers might contain crossing bonds and
star atoms.
The following copolymers can be drawn:
<ul>
<li>random(ran)
<li>alternating(alt)
<li>block with or without junction unit (blk)
<li>copolymer to represent modified polymers (mod)
<li>copolymer to represent grafted polymers (grf)
<li>copolymer to represent cross-linked polymers (xl)
</ul>

During group creation, you have the option to display the charge on the charged
atom itself or the whole group. In the latter case, the charge will be displayed
outside of the bracket on the right. If any additional charges are added (negative
or positive) the net charge will be calculated and displayed. The charge-bearing

<H3><a class="anchor" name="implicit-explicit-H">Implicit/Explicit Hydrogens</a></H3>
<P>Marvin has a number of options for the display of implicit and
explicit hydrogens. Because Marvin is chemically intelligent, it will
automatically add hydrogens as necessary within the structure.
Generally, these will be implicit and displayed based on the options
set in the <B class="buttonName">View</B>
menu.
</P>
<P>To view all hydrogens explicitly, displayed as atoms with bonds to
neighbors, chose <B class="buttonName">Structure
&gt; Add &gt; Add Explicit Hydrogens</B>. The <B class="buttonName">Structure
&gt; Remove &gt; Remove Explicit Hydrogens</B> will return to the previous display mode.
</P>
<P>To view implicit hydrogens by symbol, use the <B class="buttonName">View
&gt; Misc &gt; Implicit Hydrogens </B>menu group. This option
is disabled in Spacefill and Ball &amp; Stick display modes.
</P>

<H3><a class="anchor" name="carbon-displaying">Displaying the label of carbon atoms</a></H3>
<P>
Displaying the label of carbon atoms in structures is possible the following way:
<ul>
    <li>Always - Always show the atom labels of carbon atoms.</li> 
    <li>Never - Never show the atom labels of carbon atoms.</li> 
    <li>At straight angles and at impl. Hs - Show the atom labels of carbon atoms at straight angles and at implicit Hydrogens.</li>
</ul>
This option can be set in the  <B class="buttonName">Display</B> tab of the <B class="buttonName">Edit
&gt; Preferences </B> box.
</P>

<H3><a class="anchor" name="error-hilight">Error Highlighting</a></H3>
<P>Marvin can not automatically correct all valence errors or any reaction errors. Instead,
these errors are highlighted and you may make the
appropriate corrections yourself.
This option can be enabled and disabled through the <B class="buttonName">Edit
&gt; Preferences </B> box.
</P>


<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><a class="anchor" name="preferences">Saving Display Options</a></H2>
<p>
Many of the display settings in Marvin are saved and reloaded the next time you start the program.
    Background color, molecule color scheme, and hydrogen visibility can be set
    from the <B class="buttonName">View menu</B> and will be saved automatically when you exit the program.
    Other options, including look & feel, error highlighting, and object visibility
    can be set using the <B class="buttonName">Preferences</B> dialog window from
    the <B class="buttonName">Edit menu</B>.
</p>

<H2><a class="anchor" name="other-windows">Launching Other Windows</a></H2>
<H3>2D and 3D Viewer Windows</H3>
<P>Choosing <B class="buttonName">View &gt;Open 2D Viewer</B> or
<B class="buttonName">Open 3D Viewer</B>
launches a MarvinView window containing the current molecule of MarvinSketch.
</P>

<!--<H3>Sketcher Window</H3>
When working with applets within a web page, it may be helpful to view your
work in a MarvinSketch window outside of the html.
<BR>
To open your work in a separate Sketch window from
applets, choose <B class="buttonName">View &gt; Sketcher Window</B>.-->

<H2><a class="anchor" name="styles">How to customize structure drawing styles</a></H2>
<P>
More advanced display format can be obtained for the molecule by applying format styles.
Format styles in Marvin include the setting of the following attributes:
<ul>
<li>type of atom font,</li>
<li>size of atom font,</li>
<li>color of atoms,</li>
<li>thickness of bonds,</li>
<li>color of bonds.</li>
</ul>
All these options can be collectively set using styles.
To load or define styles use the <B class="buttonName">Edit &gt; Format...</B> menu.
This menu brings up the "Format of
the current document" dialog in which atom and bond format options can be specified.
The original attributes for
atoms and bonds can be restored by using the <B class="buttonName">Reset</B>
functions of the dialog at any time.
<p>
When loading a molecule all atoms/bonds belong to the default atom/bond set
if no styles were applied previously.
After selecting an atom/bond set and applying a style for it, the selected atoms/bonds are
removed from the default atom/bond set and a new set is created from the atoms/bonds with new style.
All the atoms/bonds, whose style were not yet modified by selection and applying a style on them,
still belong to the default atom/bond set.
<p>
Your changes might be applied for a set of atoms/bonds:
<ul>
<li>for the selected atom/bond set,</li>
<li>for the default atom/bond set,</li>
<li>for all the atoms/bonds.</li>
</ul>
The top three radio buttons specify the target of the format settings being edited
 in the dialog.

The "Apply changes for all the atoms/bonds" option allows loading of predefined styles
 or creation of custom styles using the <B class="buttonName">Load Style</B> and <B class="buttonName">Save Style</B> buttons.

<H3>Loading a style</H3>
After pressing the <B class="buttonName">Load Style</B> button, you can load a style from a combo box or browse amongst the previously defined
style files. The chosen style will be loaded into the "Structure Drawing Properties" in the "Format of the current document" dialog.
<H3>Saving a style</H3>
<p>Set the "Structure Drawing Properties" you wish to save and press the
<B class="buttonName">Save Style</B> button to get to the "Save" dialog where you can enter the name of the style file and save the style.
All your own saved files will be stored under the &lt;HOMEDIR&gt;/chemaxon/styles/ directory (where &lt;HOMEDIR&gt; is the user's home
directory) and will be added to the combobox items.
A new style file can be added to the chemaxon/marvin/styles directory under the Marvin installation directory.
This new style file has to be listed in file chemaxon/marvin/styles/styleFileList.properties. The new style file
will be copied to the &lt;HOMEDIR&gt;/chemaxon/styles/ directory and appear in the combobox of the "Loading of a journal style" dialog.
 (No existing style files under &lt;HOMEDIR&gt;/chemaxon/styles/ are overwritten)
