				<p>
					The data access policy will provide investigators access to G-DOC data in two tiers: an open-access tier containing public data, often derived from repositories such as GEO or other NCI databases, and a private tier, which will be self-managed by the individual investigators.  Private data will not be disclosed by the G-DOC team, and will remain under the full control of the depositing investigator.  Private data will be deleted at the depositor’s request.   G-DOC only stores de-identified data, and will not accept PHI data at this time.  Data is provided on an “as is” basis.</p>
				<p>	While the G-DOC team will make efforts to host high-quality “-omics” data as well as correlative clinical phenotype and outcome information (where available) from all members of the scientific community upon request, it is anticipated that G-DOC will not be able to support all such inquiries, and in cases may request charge-backs to support internal costs.
