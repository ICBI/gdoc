				<p>
				If results from the Georgetown Database of Cancer (G-DOC) are used in a scientific publication or presentation, we request that researchers include the following acknowledgment:</p>
				
				<p style="font-size:1em;font-style:italic">
				"The data/analytic tools utilized in this study were provided by the Georgetown Database of Cancer (G-DOC), an internally funded project of the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center designed to provide advanced translational research tools to the scientific community."</p>

				<p>
				This statement will be modified upon publication of the first G-DOC paper in 2011.</p>
				
				<p>
				For tracking purposes, we ask that you submit copies of all publications and presentations using G-DOC tools and/or data to the G-DOC team by emailing <a href="mailto:gdoc-help@georgetown.edu">gdoc-help@georgetown.edu</a>.   G-DOC will issue periodic updates to users on successful research projects that utilize G-DOC tools and/or data.
