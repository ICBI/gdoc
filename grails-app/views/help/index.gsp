		<a name="q1">
		<span>Q: </span>What is G-DOC, and how can it help me?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		The Georgetown Database of Cancer (G-DOC) is a searchable, integrated database of various biomedical research data types such as tissue annotations, gene expression, genetic variation, clinical trials data, health service related population data, etc. </p>
		
		<p>As a biomedical researcher, you can use these bioinformatics tools to generate powerful and testable hypotheses, analyze experimental data, explore cellular signaling networks through integrated pathway browser, share knowledge, and collaborate with others in the field.  It allows researchers to more easily access and analyze clinical and experimental research data across trials and studies from multiple cancer types as well as generate ad hoc queries and customized reports. The combination of clinical and experimental data types enables both basic and translational scientific research.</p>
		
		<p>From a clinician’s perspective, this integrated data portal of clinical, family history, pathology, and molecular data is designed to provide the oncologist/physician with all the information necessary to provide an informed decision with regard to the best treatment options for his/her new patient. By networking several aspects of the disease and exposing various data elements, such as outpatient lab workup, pathology, radiology, current treatments, molecular signatures and expected outcomes over a web interface, G-DOC will greatly enable the practice of systems medicine in the clinical setting in the future.</p>

		<a name="q43">
		<span>Q: </span>What publications exist for G-DOC?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
	The first of several anticipated G-DOC publications, describing the tool and its use, are expected to go to press in the first half of 2011.  In addition, we anticipate numerous publications and presentations to arise from the use of G-DOC by the scientific community.  New publications will be provided as they become available.</p>
	<p>This statement can be found in the "Publication Policy" link in the footer of any G-DOC page.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q1b">
		<span>Q: </span>How can I obtain training on G-DOC?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>The G-DOC team will provide periodic training sessions on the campus of Georgetown University, and over time these will also be made available online.  In addition, video tutorials and example workflows are available within the site itself on the Help page <a href="${grailsApplication.config.grails.serverURL}/gdoc/help" />${grailsApplication.config.grails.serverURL}/gdoc/help</a></p>

	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q20">
		<span>Q: </span>What web browsers do you recommend for using G-DOC?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		G-DOC should be used with the most recent versions of either Chrome (version 6.0.472.62 or better), FireFox (version 3.5 or better), or Internet Explorer (version 8 or better).  We cannot guarantee proper functioning of all features with older versions of these three, or with any other browser (e.g., Safari).  Please update your browser, Java (to version 1.6 or better) and FLASH (to 10.0 or better) before starting to use G-DOC.  Chrome is the preferred browser, as it comes bundled with FLASH.  Internet Explorer showed the largest number of peculiarities in testing among the three supported browsers. </p>

		<a name="q41">
		<span>Q: </span>I am new to using this tool, and I am unsure about how to make sure that my computer has the right settings and software to use G-DOC effectively.  Is there a way that I can check these?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
	Please select the “SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS” link in the footer on the G-DOC homepage.  This will check the FLASH, Java, and internet browsers you have installed on your computer, and compare these to the G-DOC system requirements.  Getting a “pass” on all three means that your system is ready to use G-DOC.  If any of these fail, please take corrective action to bring your machine into compliance.  Contact <a href="mailto:gdoc-help@georgetown.edu?subject=Browser Issues with G-DOC application">gdoc-help@georgetown.edu</a> for assistance.  </p>

	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q5">
		<span>Q: </span>Where do I begin after logging into G-DOC?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		The easiest way to begin is to use the Google-like open search at the center-top of the page.  Just type in what you want, and G-DOC may be able to direct you to the right place.</p>
		<p>The second easiest and quickest way to start is to click on Quick Start on G-DOC homepage.</p>
		<p>This will present you with a comprehensive view, in the form of a color-coded bar diagram, of available data sources, criteria of data available for each data source, namely clinical, metabolomics, gene expression & copy number and the total number of patients for each of the criteria.   On this page, you can also filter data based on different criteria / molecular profiling or patient outcome for different cancer types.  </p>
		<p>Other options to start are available, including clinical search – it depends on what you want to do.  The team that created G-DOC is available to help you get started – please send an email to <a href="mailto:gdoc-help@georgetown.edu?subject=Getting started with 
		G-DOC application">gdoc-help@georgetown.edu</a> to get started with the process.

		<a name="q28">
		<span>Q: </span>The FLASH object on the pre-login page is giving me trouble (“looks weird”) – what can I do?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		Please use the most recent versions of Chrome, FireFox, or Internet Explorer, and use the most up to date version of FLASH (must be version 10.0 or better).  Chrome is preferred for first time users, as it comes bundled with FLASH.  Additionally, this looks best if in a full-screen window, rather than a smaller one.  Also, sometimes the FLASH object can be resized independently of the rest of the page – this can sometimes be remedied by adjusting the View menu – Zoom function on the web browser window</p>

	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q8">
		<span>Q: </span>Are there different ways to search for data?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		Yes, many. The open search at the top of the page ("Google-like") is perhaps the fastest way to <get started – just type what you want to know about, and you may get an answer that you can use.  Sometimes, however, this is not sufficient.  The <b><i>Quick Start</i></b> feature on the G-DOC homepage is also an effective way to get started quickly by viewing summaries all available data sets.  </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q9">
		<span>Q: </span>What are the different kinds of scientific data available on G-DOC?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		The various kinds of data available are listed under Features on the G-DOC homepage and are as follows: </p>
		<p>(1) Biospecimens, where you can search for and obtain tissue / plasma samples of different disease types. </p>
		<p>(2) Clinical data, where you can search for data such as clinical, family history, pathology, outpatient lab workup, age, gender, diagnosis, treatment, risk factors etc.</p>
		<p>(3) Genome data gives info about chromosome location and the genomic features (such as genes, micro RNAs, etc.) located thereupon.</p>
		<p>(4) Compounds & their drug targets: You can search for a ligand within a specific range of molecular weight targeting the gene, protein or molecule of your interest and obtain their physical, chemical and structural characteristics. Additionally, you can also view the interaction between the ligand and target in 3D viewer.</p>
		<p>(5) Gene expression data allows you to search for microarray-based gene expression.</p>
		<p>(6) Metabolomics data, which shows the metabolites (chemicals) present in the cell.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q18">
		<span>Q: </span>I wish to search for specific clinical data.  How do I go about it?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		Click on <b><i>Search: Clinical Data</i></b> under <b><i>Features</i></b> on G-DOC homepage. Then, choose a disease/cancer type and the desired study. This will bring up multiple search parameters for that study. </p>
		<p>If you place your cursor on the symbol <img src="${createLinkTo(dir:'images',file:'information.png')}" border="0" />
		  that appears by each search parameter a box pops up that gives a description of that search criterion. You can choose to skip any query specification by either clicking on the red 'X' enclosed within that box or just ignoring it. The query options or search parameters vary depending on the specific database, e.g., searching the Breast Cancer Databases will include criteria such as estrogen and progesterone receptor status, tamoxifen treatment, BRCA gene mutation, etc.  </p>
		<p>Once you have selected your search parameters, clicking on Search at the bottom of the page will take you to the Clinical Search Results page. </p>
		<p>You can then save these searches as lists. These lists can then be used to perform advanced analyses at any point of time.</p>

	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q6">
		<span>Q: </span>Help me understand the color-coded bar diagram on G-DOC Quick Start?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		The bar diagram on G-DOC Quick Start is color-coded and shows the criteria of data availability for each data source as well as number of patients in each criterion.</p>
		<p>X-axis shows the various study names / data sources whereas Y-axis shows the number of patients.</p>
		<p>Each study / data source will have up to four different types of data criteria: clinical, metabolomics, gene expression & copy number. These are color-coded on the bar diagram. If you place your cursor on any colored bar in the bar diagram a pop-up box displaying all details will appear.</p>
		<p>Currently, not all studies have all four data categories but this area is constantly being updated as and when data becomes available.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q7">
		<span>Q: </span>What is the most effective way to use the Quick Start page?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		The easiest and quickest way to start is to click on Quick Start on G-DOC homepage.</p>
		<p>On the Quick Start page you have the option of searching for data based on the kind of data, namely clinical, metabolomics, gene expression & copy number. For instance, you can filter data for only gene expression by selecting gene expression in the drop-down menu in <b<i>>molecular profiling</i></b> and clicking on <b><i>Show data availability</i></b> for criteria. Only studies with gene expression data will be reflected in the color-coded bar diagram on the right side of the screen. <a href="#q6">See,“ Help me understand the color-coded bar diagram on G-DOC Quick Start”.</a></p>
		<p>The other quick search option on this page is to search by patient outcome for a specific disease / cancer type. Under <b><i>outcomes</i></b>, select a cancer type and an outcome: Relapse or Mortality.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q2">
		<span>Q: </span>How does the Quick Start "outcomes" feature work? What does it compare?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		The Quick Start "outcomes" feature enables the user to get a quick understanding of the studies (Take the following example: cancer type="BREAST" and outcome= "RELAPSE"). Mouse over the horizontal bars for each study to get an overview of the data. When we click on the study name, two groups are created, which are:</p>
		<p>Group 1) No relapse within predetermined period OR no relapse at all (** Note that the predetermined period can be found when mousing over the horizontal bar **)

		<p>Group 2) Had relapse</p>
		
		<p>These groups will be automatically created, enabling the user to compare and analyze the groups with ease. More groups and analysis can be performed by using the "SEARCH" and "ANALYZE" features in GDOC.</p>

	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q16">
		<span>Q: </span>I wish to find more information about a chemical that binds to a gene of interest to me. How do I do that?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		You can search for a ligand of desired affinity within a specific range of molecular weight targeting the gene, protein or molecule of your interest and obtain their physical, chemical and structural characteristics. Additionally, you can also view the interaction between the ligand and target in 3D viewer.</p>
		<p>In the blank slot for <b><i>Enter name for a gene, protein or molecule</i></b>, enter the molecule of your interest, e.g., you can enter EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor).</p>
		
		<p>In the slots provided for <b><i>molecular weight</i></b>, enter a lower and upper limit of molecular weight of the desired ligand. If not known, leave them blank.</p>
		<p>Click on <b><i>search</i></b></p>
		<p>The results of your search will be presented below the search box as a list. Each entry in the list represents a ligand molecule targeting the gene/protein of your interest and will display a table containing all the known information about the physical and chemical properties of the molecule, as well as its chemical structure. </p>
		<p>As an example, use EGFR as the target, and a set of molecules such as Hydrazone and Oxime will be displayed as potential ligands. </p>

	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q17">
		<span>Q: </span>How can I view the interaction between a protein of interest and the chemical(s) that bind to it?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		Once you’ve identified chemical agents for the gene/protein of your interest, you can take it a step further and view the ligand-target interaction in 3D Molecule-Target Viewer. To view this in 3D you will need to have Java platform installed.</p>
		<p>From the list of ligands pulled up by your search click on the name of the Target <img src="${createLinkTo(dir:'images',file:'target.png')}" border="0" />  (in this example, EGFR). A new window with Molecule-Target Viewer opens that displays the interaction of the two molecules. An option at the top of the page that says <b><i>Other Molecules for this target</i></b> allows you to choose the interaction between target and specific ligand from the list.</p>

		<a name="q26">
		<span>Q: </span>What is a genome browser?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		A genome browser is a bioinformatics tool that allows visualization and exploration of the human genome, and features thereupon. It displays a physical map of an entire chromosome and can be used to search for location of genes or sequences of interest, genetic sequence variations, microRNA gene expression etc. The interactive feature allows you to scroll over the chromosome and zoom in at any location even up to the nucleotide level. In short, a genome browser allows you to look at specific genetic sequences in their larger context.</p>

	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q19">
		<span>Q: </span>Help! My gene expression query is not working – what should I do?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		Please make sure that you used the standard nomenclature for the gene of your interest (HUGO gene symbol). Many genes have numerous alternate names in common use across the scientific literature posing a challenge. In addition to species-specific databases, approved gene names and symbols for many species can be located in the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/gquery" target="_blank">National Center for Biotechnology Information's Entrez Gene database</a>.</p>

		<a name="q21">
		<span>Q: </span>Why did I not get any results from my attempted analysis?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		If you got no returned results, you may have set overly stringent conditions, for example by selecting a very low p-value cutoff point.  To fix this, you may need to reduce the stringency. A number of factors such as clinical situation, sample size, clinical relevance, and significance of the results dictate basic criteria for setting the significance level (p-value).  Alternatively, you may have selected a very high fold change, and may need to lower it to get an appropriate number of results.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q22">
		<span>Q: </span>I got too many results from my analysis. How do I narrow it down to get a manageable number?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		You’ll need to tighten the stringency of your search criteria by lowering the p value and/or increasing the fold change filter.  This should allow you to focus on the most differential components (genes, probes, etc.)</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="answer">
		<a name="q27">
		<span>Q: </span>What is a reporter list, and where/why do I need it?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
	Reporters are needed for microarray assays, which are used to generate gene expression profiles. A gene is represented on a microarray by one or more reporters, i. e. nucleotide sequences that are designed to uniquely match its transcript, or transcripts if different splice variants exist. Affymetrix GeneChips are the most widely used microarray platform (U133A, U133B or U133 AB), and a wealth of data measured on these arrays is publicly available. Affymetrix reporters are 25-mer oligonucleotides whose sequence is complementary to the intended target (your sample). Each target is represented by a set of reporters, called composite sequences or probe set. Probe set size varies between 11 and 20, depending on the type of array, but is the same for the majority of the probe sets within one array.</p>

		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
	The Chromosomal Instability Index (CIN Index) is a method for identifying genomic regions that are likely to be subject to frequent gains and losses – a very important factor in understanding the nature of cancer genomes and their resulting biology.  To facilitate the quantification of sub-chromosomal copy number alterations, a prerequisite for the CIN Index, one can apply the Circular Binary Segmentation algorithm (Venkatraman & Olshen 2007) to count DNA copy number changes. </p>
	<p>In a typical analysis, amplification is defined as a region with a copy number greater than 3 in at least 6 contiguous SNPs, while homozygous deletion is defined as a region with a copy number less than 0.5 in at least 6 contiguous SNPs.  Hemizygous deletions are often defined as regions where the copy number falls ell between 0.5 and 1.5 in at least 6 contiguous SNPs. One may also compute such an index for each chromosome at a genome-wide scale based on the total amount of gain and loss. A chromosome-specific index may be defined as the sum of amplitudes of all gain/loss segments divided by the total number of SNPs in the chromosome, and a genome-wide CIN index may be defined as log(C1+1) + … + log(Ci+1) + … + log(C23+1), where Ci is the CIN index of chromosome i. For a gain segment, the amplitude would be the average intensity of SNP signals within the segment. For a loss segment, if one wishes to match the effect of losses to the same scale of gains, the amplitude would be calculated by 2.5+(A-2.5)(1.5-a)/1.5, where "a" is the average intensity of SNP signals within the loss segment and "A" is the maximum gain amplitude across all cases on the same chromosome.  See also Kuo, et al. 2009 (PMID 19383911).  Note that G-DOC calculates the CIN Index on the scale of chromosomal bands.</p>

		<span>Q: </span>What is Cytoscape, and how can I use it to help me?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
	Cytoscape is an open source bioinformatics software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks and biological pathways and integrating these networks with annotations, gene expression profiles and other state data.  The Cytoscape icon can be found on the saved lists page.</p>

		<span>Q: </span>What if my Cytoscape graph contains no nodes – is something wrong?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		The most likely cause is that the list of genes you have input do not have any entries in the cancer gene index data set that underlies the G-DOC implementation of Cytoscape.  The gene “PTGES3” is a good test case, as it produces a good graph – upload it via a text file and see if you get good results.</p>

		<span>Q: </span>What if my Cytoscape graph contains no nodes – is something wrong?</a><br />
		
		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		This occurrence is rare but is related to the Cytoscape plugin limitations. We have chosen, by default, to render the graph with a Cytoscape layout plugin that utilizes an algorithm to arrange the nodes in a circular pattern. At times, this layout plugin causes unexpected behavior. In the future, this issue will be addressed either by upgrading the version of Cytoscape, or using a different layout renderer.

		<p class="answerText"><span>A: </span>
		Private data is very secure in G-DOC.  In fact, all non-public data sets have strict access controls.  People with whom you share your private data cannot pass analyses or lists derived from it by attempting to share it with their group.  Only members of that group to whom you have given permission will be able to see either lists or analyses derived from your private data.  The G-DOC team will delete your private data from the site upon request.  Please also see our “Data Access Policy” link in the footer.</p>
