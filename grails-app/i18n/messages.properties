policies.dataPolicy=The data access policy will provide investigators access to {0} data in two tiers: an open-access tier containing public data, often derived from repositories such as GEO or other NCI databases, and a private tier, which will be self-managed by the individual investigators.  Private data will not be disclosed by the {0} team, and will remain under the full control of the depositing investigator.  Private data will be deleted at the depositor’s request.   {0} only stores de-identified data, and will not accept PHI data at this time.  Data is provided on an “as is” basis.
policies.quality=While the {0} team will make efforts to host high-quality "-omics" data as well as correlative clinical phenotype and outcome information (where available) from all members of the scientific community upon request, it is anticipated that {0} will not be able to support all such inquiries, and in cases may request charge-backs to support internal costs.
