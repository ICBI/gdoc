The malignant cells in T-ALL and T-LL are morphologically indistinguishable, and they share the expression of common cell surface antigens and cytogenetic characteristics. However, despite these similarities, differences in the predominant sites of disease in T-ALL and T-LL are observed. To determine if underlying biological distinctions may potentially contribute to some of these differences, the global gene expression profiles of malignant T-cell precursors in ten T-ALL and nine T-LL using DNA arrays were analyzed. Ten additional B-precursor ALL bone marrow samples, were used in a separate analysis.  <br><br>Link to GEO: <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE1577">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE1577 </a>  <br>Link to Pubmed: <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16358311">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16358311 </a>	PEDIATRIC CANCERS	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	LEU_RAETZ_2006_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1	0	1	0
