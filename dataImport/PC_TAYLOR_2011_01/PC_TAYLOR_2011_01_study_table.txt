PC_TAYLOR_2011_01	Integrative genomic profiling of human prostate cancer 	Annotation of prostate cancer genomes provides a foundation for discoveries that can impact disease understanding and treatment. Concordant assessment of DNA copy number,mRNA expression, and focused exon resequencing in 218 prostate cancer tumors identified the nuclear receptor coactivator NCOA2 as an oncogene in 11% of tumors. Additionally, the androgen-driven TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was associated with a previously unrecognized, prostate-specific deletion at chromosome 3p14 that implicates FOXP1, RYBP, and SHQ1 as potential cooperative tumor suppressors. DNA copy-number data from primary tumors revealed that copy-number alterations robustly define clusters of low- and high-risk disease beyond that achieved by Gleason score. This SuperSeries is composed of the following subset Series: GSE21034: Whole-transcript and exon-level expression data for human primary and metastatic prostate cancer samples and control normal adjacent benign prostate. GSE21035: Agilent 244K aCGH data for human primary and metastatic prostate cancer samples. GSE21036: MicroRNA expression data for human primary and metastatic prostate cancer samples and control normal adjacent benign prostate. <br><br> Link to GEO: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE21032">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE21032</a> ;  <br> Link to Pubmed:<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2057994">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20579941</a><br><br> The data set contains <179> samples with mRNA expression data (measured on Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array), <141> samples with microRNA expression data (measured on Human miRNA Microarray 2.0 G4470B) and <218> samples with DNA copy number data (measured on Agilent-014693 Human Genome CGH Microarray 244A).
