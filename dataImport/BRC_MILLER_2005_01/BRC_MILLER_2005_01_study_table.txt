BRC_MILLER_2005_01	An expression signature for p53 in breast cancer predicts mutation status, transcriptional effects, and patient survival	The biological tumor samples (ie, breast tumor specimens) consisted of freshly frozen breast tumors from a population-based cohort of 315 women representing 65% of all breast cancers resected in Uppsala County, Sweden, from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1989. Estrogen receptor status was determined by biochemical assay as part of the routine clinical procedure. An experienced pathologist determined the Elston-Ellis grades of the tumors, classifying the tumors into low, medium and high-grade tumors. The clinico-pathological characteristics accompanying each tumor include p53 status, ER status, tumor grade, lymph node status and patient age. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE3494">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE3494</a>; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16141321">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16141321</a>	BREAST CANCER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	BRC_MILLER_2005_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
