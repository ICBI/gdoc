The prognostic value with respect to age is also investigated.<br/>Keywords: biomarker identification.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE7378">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE7378</a>	BREAST	Sample iid	1	PUBLIC	BRC_ZHOU_2008_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1,1
