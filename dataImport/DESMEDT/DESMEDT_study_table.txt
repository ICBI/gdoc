DESMEDT	GGI: a potential predictor of relapse for endocrine-treated breast cancer patients in the BIG 1-98 trial	"Background: We have previously shown that the Gene expression Grade Index (GGI) was able to identify two subtypes of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors that were associated with statistically distinct clinical outcomes in both untreated and tamoxifen-treated patients. Here, we aim to investigate the ability of the GGI to predict relapses in postmenopausal women who were treated with tamoxifen (T) or letrozole (L) within the BIG 1-98 trial. "		Sample iid	1	PUBLIC	DESMEDT	1	"CLINIC, MICROARRAY"	"1, 1"
