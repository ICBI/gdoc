No MRI correlate or explanation for the left nipple discharge.    RIGHT BREAST: There is minimal background enhancement. At 10 o'clock mid-depth, there is a suspiciously enhancing (Mixed with Type 2 and 3), irregular, spiculated mass seen, measuring 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.8 cm. This is highly suspicious for malignancy. (series 601 and 401 slice location 68-88; images are annotated on PACS, tumor is circled). No additional foci of suspicious enhancement  or areas of architectural distortion seen within the right breast. There is no skin thickening, nipple inversion, or right axillary lymphadenopathy present.   IMPRESSION:    1) Highly suspicious 2 cm right breast mass at 10 o'clock - as seen on Ultrasound. No MRI evidence of satellite lesions or lymphadenopathy.  2) No evidence of malignancy of the left breast. No MRI correlate for the left nipple discharge. Final disposition of the left nipple discharge has to be based on clinical assessment.  3) Incidental note is made of displaced Colon portions into the right hemithorax. Further imaging (dedicated CT or MRI)  needed for complete assessment, if this in not clinically known already."

As seen on the prior screening mammogram, there is a circumscribed, round 9 mm nodule at approximately 8 o'clock, with a punctate calcification. Otherwise, no suspicious dominant or spiculated masses, suspicious clustered microcalcifications or areas of unexplained architectural distortion are seen."
