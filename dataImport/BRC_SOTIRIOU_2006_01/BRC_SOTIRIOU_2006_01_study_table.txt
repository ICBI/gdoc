BRC_SOTIRIOU_2006_01	Gene Expression Profiling in Breast Cancer: Understanding the Molecular Basis of Histologic Grade To Improve Prognosis	Background: Histologic grade in breast cancer provides clinically important prognostic information. However, 30%-60% of tumors are classified as histologic grade 2. This grade is associated with an intermediate risk of recurrence and is thus not informative for clinical decision making. We examined whether histologic grade was associated with gene expression profi les of breast cancers and whether such profi les could be used to improve histologic grading. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE2990">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE2990</a>; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16478745">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16478745</a>	BREAST	Sample iid	1	PUBLIC	BRC_SOTIRIOU_2006_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
