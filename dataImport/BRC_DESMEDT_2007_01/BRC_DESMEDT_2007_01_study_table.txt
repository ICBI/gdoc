BRC_DESMEDT_2007_01	Strong Time Dependence of the 76-Gene Prognostic Signature	Background: Recently a 76-gene prognostic signature able to predict distant metastases in lymph node-negative (N-) breast cancer patients was reported. The aims of this study conducted by TRANSBIG were to independently validate these results and to compare the outcome with clinical risk assessment. Materials and Methods: Gene expression profiling of frozen samples from 198 N- systemically untreated patients was performed at the Bordet Institute, blinded to clinical data and independent of Veridex. Genomic risk was defined by Veridex, blinded to clinical data. Survival analyses, done by an independent statistician, were performed with the genomic risk and adjusted for the clinical risk, defined by Adjuvant!Online.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE7390">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE7390</a>;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17545524">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17545524</a>	BREAST	Sample iid	1	PUBLIC	BRC_DESMEDT_2007_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
