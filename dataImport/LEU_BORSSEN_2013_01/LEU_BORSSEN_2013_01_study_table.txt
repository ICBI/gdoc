LEU_BORSSEN_2013_01	Genome wide gene expression array analysis in T-ALL	"The objective with the gene expression array (Illumina HT-12 v.4) analysis of 17 T-ALL samples was to correlate gene expression levels with DNA promoter methylation status. Treatment of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) has improved, but there is a considerable fraction of patients experiencing a poor outcome. There is a need for better prognostic markers and aberrant DNA methylation is a candidate in other malignancies, but its potential prognostic significance in T-ALL is hitherto undecided. <br><br>Link to GEO: <a href= ""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE41621"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE41621</a>  <br>Link to Pubmed: <a href= ""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23762353>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23762353 </a>"	PEDIATRIC CANCERS	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	LEU_BORSSEN_2013_01	1	"CLINIC, MICROARRAY"	"1, 1"
