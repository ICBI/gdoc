A clear defect in muscle function becomes generally apparent by the end of the second year. As the disease is typically diagnosed between the ages of 3 and 7, the first two years are often considered and referred to as clinically presymptomatic. The authors sought to investigate whether and to which extent alterations may be present in muscle from presymptomatic DMD infants. To this aim, Affymetrix technology (Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array) was used to compare the individual expression profiles of 19 DMD patients with age at biopsy scattered along the first two years of the disease with those of 14 age matched controls. <br> <br> Link to full text: <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17264171">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17264171</a> <br> <br> <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE6011">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE6011</a>	MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	DMD_PESCATORI_2007_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1	0	1	0
