Although much research has examined molecular pathways associated with AD, relatively few studies have focused on critical early stages. The authors' prior microarray study correlated gene expression in human hippocampus with AD markers. Results suggested a new model of early-stage AD in which pathology spreads along myelinated axons, orchestrated by upregulated transcription and epigenetic factors related to growth and tumor suppression (Blalock et al., 2004). However, the microarray analyses were performed on RNA from fresh frozen hippocampal tissue blocks containing both gray and white matter, potentially obscuring region-specific changes. In the present study, the author used laser capture microdissection to exclude major white matter tracts and selectively collect CA1 hippocampal gray matter from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) hippoc ampal sections of the same subjects assessed in our prior study. They conclude that FFPE tissue can be a reliable resource for microarray studies, that upregulation of growth-related epigenetic/ transcription factors with incipient AD is predominantly localized to white matter, further supporting our prior findings and model, and that alterations in vascular and ryanodine receptor-relat ed pathways in gray matter are closely associated with incipient AD. <br> <br> Link to full text: <a href= ""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21756998"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21756998</a> <br> <br> <a href= ""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE28146"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE28146</a>"	DEMENTIA	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	AD_BLALOCK_2011_01	1	"CLINIC, MICROARRAY"	"1, 1"	0	1	0
