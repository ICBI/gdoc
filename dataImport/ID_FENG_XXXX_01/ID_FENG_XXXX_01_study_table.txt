MiRNA as a class of regulators in cancer development can affect multiple gene pathways by targeting various mRNAs. Thus, studies aimed at transcription and regulation after antiviral treatment combined with beneficial researches related to miRNAs are required. With the purpose of identifying the cascaded miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships related to infection of HIV in gene level, the parallel miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were analyzed in the study. <br> <br> The microarray profiles utilized in the study was derived from Chengdu University of TCM in Sichuan, China. All donors as experimental group were confirmed as AIDS clinical patients according to 1994 revised classification system for HIV infection in America using protein western blotting by local epidemic station. The diagnosis standards to patients were referred to the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of HIV/AIDS in China (2005). The patients were accepted if they conformed to the following criteria: (a) corresponding to the criteria for diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS; (b) ranging in age from 4 to 78 years old; (c) agreeing to sign an informed consent form. In the study, there were fifty AIDS patients and seven healthy persons as control group donated blood samples. Controls were all healthy, HIV-1-negative donors. Whereas, two more representative groups named Low Viral Load (LVL) and High Viral Load (HVL) were further defined according to the viral load of the patients in order to explore the relationship between virus load and gene expression level after antiviral therapy. The LVL group includes 14 samples from patients while HVL group includes 16 AIDS samples. In addition, a further 36 independent blood samples from 33 AIDS patients and 3 healthy donors were applied to test and verify the accuracy of the differential expression results.  <br> <br> Experiment: Morning fasting venous blood samples from donors were collected for RNA extraction. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood by Ficoll gradient separation. In order to achieve lysis and inactivate endogenous, RNAses Cells were mixed with mirVana RNA lysis buffer (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA). Then the lysates were frozen at -80 degreeC until RNA purification. Total RNA was amplified and labeled by Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit, One-Color (Cat#5190-2305, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US), following the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled cRNA were purified by RNeasy mini kit (Cat#74106, QIAGEN, GmBH, Germany). Data were extracted with Feature Extraction software 10.7 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US). Raw data were normalized by Quantile algorithm, Gene Spring Software 11.0 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US). <br> <br> Platform: Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44K G4112F (GPL6480), Agilent-046064 Unrestricted_Human_miRNA_V19.0_Microarray (GPL19730) <br> Raw data processing: With a total of 37 samples, the raw data from all of the 37 samples was handled within the R statistical computing framework version 3.0.2 (http://www.R-project.org) to obtain the processed data. As for miRNA raw data, R package AgiMicroRna providing useful functionality for the following processing, quality assessment for Agilent microRNA array data was employed used. In AgiMicroRna, the processed microRNA signal can be obtained using total Gene Signal (TGS) computed by the AFE and RMA algorithm. There were altogether 499 probes with corresponding miRNA in subsequent analysis after the normalization. As well as for mRNA, R package Agi4x44PreProcess was used for background correction, normalization and filtering probes according to different quality flags during the microarray standardization in the study. <br><br>Link to GEO: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76246"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76246</a> "	INFECTIOUS DISEASES	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	ID_FENG_XXXX_01	1	"CLINIC, MICROARRAY,MICRORNA"	"1,1,1"	0	1	0
