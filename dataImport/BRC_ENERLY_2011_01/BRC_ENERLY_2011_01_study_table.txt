BRC_ENERLY_2011_01	Molecular Characterization of Breast Cancer Subtypes Derived from Joint Analysis of High Throughput miRNA and mRNA Data	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, single-stranded widely expressed noncoding RNAs that regulate the stability or translational efficiency of target messenger RNAs. Date derived from expression profiling of 489 miRNAs in 101 human primary breast tumor samples, along with genome-wide matched mRNA profiling and extensive clinical information were investigated in this study. miRNA and mRNA expression were analyzed using correlations and enrichments analyses. The results show that particular cellular processes such as proliferation, cell adhesion, and immune response are significantly enriched among genes with strong positive or negative correlation to individual or groups of miRNAs. miRNA profiling from 101 breast cancer samples was performed. Experiments were mostly performed using duplicate hybridizations (99 samples) on different arrays and time points. Two samples were profiled only once.mRNA profiling from 114 breast cancer samples was performed.
