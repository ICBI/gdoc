OV_TCGA_2011_01	Integrated genomic analyses of ovarian carcinoma by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network	Ovarian cancer is the fifth-leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States; 21,880 new cases and 13,850 deaths were estimated to have occurred in 20101. Most deaths (around 70%) are of patients presenting with advanced-stage, high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa). The standard treatment is aggressive surgery followed by platinum–taxane chemotherapy. After therapy, platinum resistant cancer recurs in approximately 25% of patients within six months, and the overall five-year survival probability is 31% . Approximately 13% of HGS-OvCa is attributable to germline mutations in BRCA1/2 , and a smaller percentage can be accounted for by other germline mutations. However, most ovarian cancer can be attributed to a growing number of somatic aberrations. <br>The lack of successful treatment strategies led the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) researchers to measure comprehensively genomic and epigenomic abnormalities on clinically annotated HGS-OvCa samples to identify molecular abnormalities that influence pathophysiology, affect outcome and constitute therapeutic targets. Microarray analyses produced high-resolution measurements of mRNA expression, microRNA (miRNA) expression and DNA copy number associated with survival duration shed new light on the impact that tumours with BRCA1/2 (BRCA1 or BRCA2) and CCNE1 aberrations have on survival. <br><br> Link to data: <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</a>  <br>Link to pubmed: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21720365">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21720365</a> <br><br> A subset of the data provided in this paper is captured in this study. This subset consists of 283 samples with mRNA expression data (measured using Affymetrix U133A chip), 281 samples with microRNA expression data (measured on Agilent chip) and 181 samples with DNA copy number data (measured on Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Chip).
