ID_QIAN_2013_01	Impaired Toll-Like Receptor 3-Mediated Immune Responses from Macrophages of Patients Chronically Infected with Hepatitis C Virus	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States with the majority of patients becoming chronically infected and a subset (20%) progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Individual variations in immune responses may help define successful resistance to infection with HCV. We have examined the immune response in primary macrophages from patients who have spontaneously cleared HCV (viral load negative, VL-, n = 37) compared to HCV genotype 1 chronically infected (VL+) subjects (n=32) and found that macrophages from VL- subjects have an elevated baseline expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Macrophages from HCV patients were stimulated ex vivo through the TLR3 pathway and assessed using gene expression arrays and pathway analysis. We found elevated TLR3 response genes and pathway activity from VL- subjects. Furthermore, macrophages from VL- subjects showed higher production of IFN-b and related IFN response genes by Q-PCR, and increased phosphorylation of STAT-1 by immunoblot. Analysis of polymorphisms in TLR3 revealed a significant association of intronic TLR3 polymorphism (rs13126816) with the clearance of HCV and the expression of TLR3. Of note, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the same donors showed opposite changes in gene expression, suggesting ongoing inflammatory responses in PBMCs from VL+ HCV patients. Our results suggest that an elevated innate immune response enhances HCV clearance mechanisms and may offer a potential therapeutic approach to increase viral clearance. <br> <br> Experiment: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated, and monocyte-derived macrophages were derived. PBMCs and macrophages were stimulated for 24 h with TLR ligands polyinosinic-poly(C) [poly IC]. Total RNA from paired macrophage and PBMC samples from VLâˆ’ and VL+ subjects was harvested using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, CA) and assessed for transcriptional changes using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Beadchip whole human genome expression array. <br> The dataset consists of 20 patients sampled four times: (a)PBMCs with Mock treatment (b)PBMCs with Poly IC (c)Monocyte-derived macrophages with Mock treatment and (d)Monocyte-derived macrophages with Poly IC <br><br> Platform: Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip (GPL10558) <br> Raw data processing:  Microarray data from the validation cohort underwent quantile normalization using the lumi package in bioconductor [R version 2.13.2, Lumi version 2.4, Limma version 3.8.3].<br><br>Link to GEO: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40812">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40812</a> <br>Link to study in ImmPort: <a href="http://www.immport.org/immport-open/public/study/study/displayStudyDetail/SDY162">http://www.immport.org/immport-open/public/study/study/displayStudyDetail/SDY162</a> <br>Publication URL: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23220997">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23220997</a>	INFECTIOUS DISEASES	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	ID_QIAN_2013_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1,1	0	1	0
