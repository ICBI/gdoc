BRC_CICATIELLO_2010_03	Transcription profiling of human estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell lines treated with 17beta-estradiol for 1 to 32 hours	Human estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell lines ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 were treated with 10nM of 17beta-estradiol. Gene expression was analyzed on total RNA extracted before or after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 hours hormonal stimulation. For each condition 2 technical replicates were performed, except the reference sample (before stimulation - 0h) which was in respectively in quadruplicate and quintuplicate.<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-TABM-742">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-TABM-742</a>; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20348243"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20348243</a> 	BREAST CANCER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	BRC_CICATIELLO_2010_03	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
