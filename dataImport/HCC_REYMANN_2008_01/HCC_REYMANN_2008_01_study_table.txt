HCC_REYMANN_2008_01	Topoisomerase II inhibition involves characteristic chromosomal expression patterns	This SuperSeries is composed of the following subset Series: <br> GSE11940: Topoisomerase II inhibition involves characteristic chromosomal expression patterns: Doxorubicin study. A variety of important anticancer drugs kill cells by increasing cellular levels of topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex. The anthracycline anticancer drug doxorubicin forms a stable ternary complex with DNA and topoisomerase IIa, thereby inhibiting the normal function of the enzyme. In this study we found genes regulated by doxorubicin - induced and repressed - to be located much closer to each other than genes distributed randomly all over the genome (< 100 kbp). <br> GSE11941: Topoisomerase II inhibition involves characteristic chromosomal expression patterns: Trovafloxacin study. Trovafloxacin is a broad spectrum antibiotic that inhibits the uncoiling of supercoiled DNA in various bacteria by blocking the activity of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Specific members of this drug family display high activity against eukaryotic type II topoisomerase, as well as cultured mammalian cells and in vivo tumor models. Trovafloxacin seems to have a higher affinity for eukaryotic polymerase II system than the other quinolone agents tested. This effect coupled with other factors, such as an inflammatory response, might result in a hepatotoxic reaction seen with drug. In this study we found genes regulated by trovafloxacin - induced and repressed - to be located much closer to each other than genes distributed randomly all over the genome (< 100 kbp). <br><br> Link to GEO: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE11942">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE11942</a> <br> Link to Pubmed: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18611269">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18611269</a>	LIVER CANCER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	HCC_REYMANN_2008_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
