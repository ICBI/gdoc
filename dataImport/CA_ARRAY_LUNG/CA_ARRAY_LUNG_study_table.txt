It is a large, training, testing, multi-site, blinded validation study to characterize the performance of several prognostic models based on gene expression for 442 lung adenocarcinomas. The hypotheses proposed examined whether microarray measurements of gene expression either alone or combined with basic clinical covariates (stage, age, sex) could be used to predict overall survival in lung cancer subjects. Several models examined produced risk scores that substantially correlated with actual subject outcome. Most methods performed better with clinical data, supporting the combined use of clinical and molecular information when building prognostic models for early-stage lung cancer. This study also provides the largest available set of microarray data (on a Arrymetrix HG-U133A chip) with extensive pathological and clinical annotation for lung adenocarcinomas  <br> <br> The mapping file between the G-DOC IDs and the CaArray IDs is here: <a href="https://gdoc.georgetown.edu/mapping/CaArrayLung.xlsx">https://gdoc.georgetown.edu/mapping/CaArrayLung.xlsx</a><br><br> Link to ArrayXpress: (available soon) <br><br> Publication URL: <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18641660">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18641660</a>	LUNG CANCER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	CA_ARRAY_LUNG	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1	0	1	0
