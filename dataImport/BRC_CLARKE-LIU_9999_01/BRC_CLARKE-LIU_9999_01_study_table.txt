BRC_CLARKE-LIU_9999_0	Clarke-Liu Data Set	Toxicity from endocrine therapy is usually more tolerable than from cytotoxic chemotherapy, and the proportional benefits are higher for postmenopausal women with ER+ disease. ER and/or PgR status are useful predictors of responsiveness to endocrine agents but treatment failure is seen in about 50% of cases. Partly for this reason, sequential combination chemotherapy and endocrine therapy may be prescribed. The ability to predict endocrine responsiveness more accurately could decrease the need for chemotherapy in many patients. A predictor that could further direct specific endocrine therapies (e.g., antiestrogen vs. aromatase inhibitor), i.e., identify individual patients with either a very high or very low risk of responding to one or the other drug, also would have widespread use.
