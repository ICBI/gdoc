They vary substantially in their natural history and show important clinical differences from their adult counterparts. To address the biological basis for these observations, the authors have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of global gene expression patterns in pediatric malignant GCTs and compared these findings with published data on adult testicular GCTs (TGCT). The study included 27 primary tumors and assessed the principal malignant histologic types of pediatric GCT, yolk sac tumor (YST; n = 18), and seminoma (n = 9).  The primary aim was to compare the two principal histologic types, seminomatous tumors (hereafter termed seminoma, irrespective of site of origin) and YSTs. They compared their results with published adult TGCT transcriptome data (8) obtained using the same microarray platform, to identify differences in gene expression signature related to clinicopathologic variables, such as histologic type, genomic imbalances, site of origin, and patient age. <br> <br> Link to full text: <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519683">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519683</a> <br> <br> <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE10615">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE10615</a>	PEDIATRIC CANCERS	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	GCT_PALMER_2008_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1	0	1	0
