The 1000 Genomes Project aims to provide a deep characterization of human genome sequence variation as a foundation for investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Here results of the pilot phase of the project are shown, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. Three projects were undertaken: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations.  Because of the catalogued vast majority of common variation, over 95% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. These results can be used to inform association and functional studies and will support the next phase of human genetic research. <br> <br> Link to full text: <a href= http://www.1000genomes.org/sites/1000genomes.org/files/docs/nature09534.pdf>http://www.1000genomes.org/sites/1000genomes.org/files/docs/nature09534.pdf</a> 	OTHER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	THE_1000_GENOMES_PROJECT_02	1	CLINIC, WGS 	1, 1 	1	0	0
