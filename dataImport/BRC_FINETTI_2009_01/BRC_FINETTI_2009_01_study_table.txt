BRC_FINETTI_2009_01	Molecular profiling of ERBB2-amplified breast cancers	15-25% of breast cancers (BC) show ERBB2-amplification and overexpression of the encoded ERBB2 tyrosine kinase receptor. They are associated with a poor prognosis but can benefit from targeted therapy. A better knowledge of these BCs may help understand their behavior and design new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we defined the high resolution genome and gene expression profiles of 54 ERBB2-amplified BCs using 244K oligonucleotide array-comparative genomic hybridization and whole-genome DNA microarrays. We first identified the ERBB2-C17orf37-GRB7 genomic segment as the minimal common amplicon, and CRKRS and IKZF3 as the most frequent centromeric and telomeric amplicon borders, respectively. Second, we identified 17 genome regions affected by copy number aberration (CNA). The expression of 37 genes of these regions was deregulated. Third, two types of heterogeneity were observed in ERBB2-amplified BCs.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE17907">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE17907</a> 	BREAST	Sample iid	1	PUBLIC	BRC_FINETTI_2009_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
