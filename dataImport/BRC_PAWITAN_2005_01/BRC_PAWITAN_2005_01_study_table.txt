BRC_PAWITAN_2005_01	Gene expression of breast cancer tissue in a large population-based cohort of Swedish patients	Gene expression profiling spares early breast cancer patients from adjuvant therapy. Discriminatory gene expression signatures on untreated and systematically treated primary breast cancer patients have the potential to be spared from adjuvant therapy. Tissue material was collected from all breast cancer patients receiving surgery at Karolinska Hospital from 1994-1996. Material was frozen immediatley on dry ice or in liquid nitrogen and stored in -70°C freezers. This series contains expression data for n=159 tumors from which RNA could be collected in sufficient amounts and quality for analysis. <br><br> Link to GEO: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE1456">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE1456</a>; <br> Link to Pubmed: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280042">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280042</a>	BREAST CANCER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	BRC_PAWITAN_2005_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
