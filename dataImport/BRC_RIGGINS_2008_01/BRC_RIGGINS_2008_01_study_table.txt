BRC_RIGGINS_2008_01	ERRgamma (ESRRG) mediates Tamoxifen resistance in novel models of invasive lobular breast cancer	One-third of all ER+ breast tumors treated with endocrine therapy fail to respond, and the remainder are likely to relapse in the future. Almost all data on endocrine resistance has been obtained in models of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). However, invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) comprise up to 15% of newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers diagnosed each year and, while the incidence of IDC has remained relatively constant during the last 20 years, the prevalence of ILC continues to increase among postmenopausal women. This study reports a new model of Tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant invasive lobular breast carcinoma cells that provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of endocrine resistance. <br> <br> Design: Total RNA was extracted from sub-confluent T-25 cm^2 tissue culture flasks of SUM44 and LCCTam cells, then processed and arrayed. <br> <br> Platform: Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array (HG-U133A) <br> <br> About the cell line: The study compares invasive lobular breast carcinoma cell line SUM44 and its TAM-resistant variant, LCCTam, href="http://www.asterand.com/asterand/human_tissues/44PE.htm"> http://www.asterand.com/asterand/human_tissues/44PE.htm</a> <br> <br> Link to GEO: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE12708">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE12708</a>  <br>Link to pubmed: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974135">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974135</a>	BREAST CANCER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	BRC_RIGGINS_2008_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
