BRC_KUMAR_RIGGINS_9999_01	Effect of BPA on gene expression in MCF10A cells	"Endocrine disrupting chemicals when absorbed into the body interfere with body’s endocrine system by either mimicking or blocking hormones.  Bisphenol A [BPA; 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane] is an endocrine disruptor found as aquatic pollutant that originates mainly from plastic industry. Several studies have linked BPA exposure to fish toxicity, ecosystem misbalance and also, diabetes, insulin (INS) resistance, mammary tumorigenesis in rodents, and poor survival outcome and response to chemotherapy in human breast cancer. The molecular mechanisms involved in BPA toxicity are not well understood. Microarray technology is a powerful way to simultaneously detect the expression of mammalian genome and identify the modulated genes regulating BPA toxicity. In the present proposal we aim to use such high throughput genomics technology and study the transcriptome changes that occur due to BPA exposure in MCF-10A mammalian breast cells. The study will help in understanding the mechanism of action of BPA on MCF-10A mammalian breast cells as a model using systems approaches to study simultaneous gene expression patterns of signaling molecules in response to Bisphenol-A. This study will identify new targets involved in BPA signaling. <br><br> Experiment design:  Three replicates were treated with BPA compound and the other three with vehicle control (ethanol, EtOH). Affymetrix expression arrays (U133 Plus 2.0) was used. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit, and 5 micrograms of total RNA was amplified, labeled and hybridized to the array according to the manufacturer's protocols. <br><br> Media and Supplements: Each replicate was treated with 10 nM BPA or equivalent volume EtOH. Total RNA was extracted after 24 hours. <br><br> About MCF10A cell line: The MCF 10A cell line is a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line. The line is responsive to insulin, glucocorticoids, cholera enterotoxin, and epidermal growth factor (EGF). It also expresses breast-specific antigens as detected by positive reaction with MFA-Breast and MC-5 monoclonal antibodies. It is derived from a 36 year old Caucasian female. <br> ATCC Link: <a href=""http://www.atcc.org/ATCCAdvancedCatalogSearch/ProductDetails/tabid/452/Default.aspx?ATCCNum=CRL-10317&Template=cellBiology"">http://www.atcc.org/ATCCAdvancedCatalogSearch/ProductDetails/tabid/452/Default.aspx?ATCCNum=CRL-10317&Template=cellBiology</a>"	BREAST CANCER	Sample id	1	PRIVATE	BRC_KUMAR_RIGGINS_9999_01	1	"CLINIC, MICROARRAY"	"1, 1"
