A subset of these data was used as the ""CALGB 9761 Validation Cohort"" in the following publication: <a href= ""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21366430"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21366430</a> <br> <br> Note: After publication, additional adjuvant treatment data was requested by readers.  Further investigation revealed that some patients originally identified as ""Unknown"" were members of clinical trials or treated in clinical contexts where the adjuvant treatment status could be inferred from the protocol or context.  Therefore, these patients have been recoded.  All these changes are from ""Unknown"" to ""No"" for both adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy.  These reflect the REMBRANDT team's best efforts to retrieve these data, although chart review was not feasible"	LUNG CANCER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	REMBRANDT_LUNG	1	"CLINIC, MICROARRAY"	"1, 1"
