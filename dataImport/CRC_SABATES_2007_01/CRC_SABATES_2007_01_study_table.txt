CRC_SABATES_2007_01	Transcriptome profile of human colorectal adenomas.	Background: Colorectal cancers are believed to arise predominantly from adenomas. Although these precancerous lesions have been subjected to extensive clinical, pathological, and molecular analyses, little is currently known about the global gene expression changes accompanying their formation. Results: To characterize the molecular processes underlying the transformation of normal colonic epithelium, we compared the transcriptomes of 32 prospectively collected adenomas with those of normal mucosa from the same individuals. Important differences emerged not only between the expression profiles of normal and adenomatous tissues, but also between those of small and large adenomas. A key feature of the transformation process was the remodeling of the Wnt pathway reflected in patent over- and underexpression of 78 known components of this signaling cascade. Conclusions: Our transcriptomic profiles of normal colonic mucosa and colorectal adenomas shed new light on the early stages of colorectal tumorigenesis. <br><br>Link to GEO: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE8671">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE8671</a><br> Link to Pubmed: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18171984">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18171984</a>	COLON CANCER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	CRC_SABATES_2007_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
