The cell lines within the NCI-60 panel of human tumor cell lines are perhaps some of the most extensively characterized cell lines in broad laboratory use. They are comprised of 60 cell lines from 9 different cancer tissue of origin types (Breast, Central Nervous System, Colon, Leukemia, Melanoma, Non-Small Cell Lung, Ovarian, Prostate, Renal). In this study, we present a multi-omic characterization of the NCI-60 cell line collection <br> <br> Link to full text: <a href= Òhttp://dtp.nci.nih.gov/">http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/</a> <br> <br> The gene expression data was taken from: <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE32474">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE32474</a>	CELL_LINE_COLLECTIONS	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	NCI60_CELL_LINE_COLLECTION	1	CLINIC, MICRORNA, MICROARRAY	1,1,1	0	1	0
