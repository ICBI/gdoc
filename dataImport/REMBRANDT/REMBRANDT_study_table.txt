Primary brain tumors are the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality in adults under the age of 54 years and the leading cause of cancer mortality in children in the United States. Therapy for the most common type of primary brain tumors, gliomas, remains suboptimal. The development of new and more effective treatments will likely require a better understanding of the biology of these tumors. Here, we show that use of the high-density 100K single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays in a large number of primary tumor samples allows for a much higher resolution survey of the glioma genome than has been previously reported in any tumor type. We not only confirmed alterations in genomic areas previously reported to be affected in gliomas, but we also refined the location of those sites and uncovered multiple, previously unknown regions that are affected by copy number alterations (amplifications, homozygous and heterozygous deletions) as well as allelic imbalances (loss of heterozygosity/gene conversions). The wealth of genomic data produced may allow for the development of a more rational molecular classification of gliomas and serve as an important starting point in the search for new molecular therapeutic targets. <br> <br> This dataset was generated through the Glioma Molecular Diagnostic Initiative from 874 glioma specimens comprising 566 gene expression arrays (Affymetrix U133 Plus 2), 834 copy number arrays (two Affymetrix 50K SNP arrays), and 13,472 clinical phenotype data points. <br> <br> Copy number data processing:  Two Arrymetrix 50K SNPs arrays designed for different restriction enzymes - XbaI and HindIII were used. Each sample was  analyzed on both the arrays. The DNA sample was treated with different enzymes that cut DNA in pieces, and processed separately. <br> <br> The mapping file between the G-DOC IDs and the Rembrandt IDs is here: <a href="https://gdoc.georgetown.edu/mapping/Rembrandt.xlsx">https://gdoc.georgetown.edu/mapping/Rembrandt.xlsx</a><br><br> <br>Publication URL: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19208739">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19208739</a><br><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17018597">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17018597</a> <br><br> Link to ArrayXpress (gene epxression data): <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3073/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3073/</a> 	BRAIN CANCER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	REMBRANDT	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY,COPY_NUMBER	1, 1,1	0	1	0
