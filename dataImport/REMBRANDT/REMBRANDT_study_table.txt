The sample collection was accompanied by careful and prospective clinical data acquisition, allowing matched molecular and clinical data analyses. The aim was to integrate molecular data with clinical annotations to identify new targets for therapy.<br> Copy number data processing:  Two Arrymetrix 50K SNPs arrays designed for different restriction enzymes - XbaI and HindIII were used. Each sample was  analyzed on both the arrays. The DNA sample was treated with different enzymes that cut DNA in pieces, and processed separately.  There were very few SNPs common to both the 50K arrays. <br>Link to full text: <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19208739">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19208739</a> <br> Link to experiment in Array Express: <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3073/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3073/</a><br>	BRAIN TUMORS	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	REMBRANDT	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY,COPY_NUMBER	1, 1,1
