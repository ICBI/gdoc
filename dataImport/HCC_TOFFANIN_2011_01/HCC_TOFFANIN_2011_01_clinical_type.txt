BCLC_STAGE		BCLC_STAGE	BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) Stage	Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification takes into account the extent of cancer and the liver function. It comprises four stages that select the best candidates for the best therapies currently available. Early stage (A) includes patients with asymptomatic early tumors suitable for radical therapies--resection, transplantation or percutaneous treatments. Intermediate stage (B) comprises patients with asymptomatic multinodular HCC. Advanced stage (C) includes patients with symptomatic tumors and/or an invasive tumoral pattern (vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread). Stage B and C patients may receive palliative treatments/new agents in the setting of phase II investigations or randomized controlled trials. End-stage disease (D) contain patients with extremely grim prognosis (Okuda stage III or PST 3-4) that should merely receive symptomatic treatment. 	CLINICAL					1	0	1	VARCHAR2(25)
