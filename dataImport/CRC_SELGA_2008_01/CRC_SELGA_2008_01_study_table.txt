CRC_SELGA_2008_01	Role of Caveolin 1, E-Cadherin, Enolase 2 and PKCa on resistance to methotrexate in human HT29 colon cancer cells	Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the earliest cytotoxic drugs used in cancer therapy, and despite the isolation of multiple other folate antagonists, methotrexate maintains its significant role as a treatment for different types of cancer and other disorders. The usefulness of treatment with methotrexate is limited by the development of drug resistance, which may be acquired through different ways. To get insights into the mechanisms associated with drug resistance and sensitization we have performed a functional analysis of genes deregulated in methotrexate resistant cells, either due to its co-amplification with the DHFR gene or as a result of a transcriptome screening using microarrays. In the present study, we wanted to identify genes implicated in MTX resistance in HT29 colon cancer cells and to explore their relative contribution to this phenotype. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE11440">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE11440</a>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19732436">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19732436</a> 	COLON CANCER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	CRC_SELGA_2008_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
