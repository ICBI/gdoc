ALTERNATE_NAME	HTB-38	HTB-38		The alternate name for HT29 cell line is HTB-38
SOURCE	COLON CANCER	COLON CANCER		This sample has been isolated from a colon cancer cell
GROWTH_PROPERTIES	ADHERENT	ADHERENT		"This sample has an adherent growth property. Adherent cells require a surface, such as tissue culture plastic or microcarrier, which may be coated with extracellular matrix components to increase adhesion properties and provide other signals needed for growth and differentiation. Most cells derived from solid tissues are adherent."
ORGANISM	HUMAN	HUMAN		This sample has been isolated from the human species
MORPHOLOGY	EPITHELIAL	EPITHELIAL		"This sample has cells with Epithelial-like morphology. Epithelial-like cells are polygonal in shape with more regular dimensions, and grow attached to a substrate in discrete patches."
GENDER	FEMALE	FEMALE		This sample has been isolated from an organism whose gender is female
RACE	CAUCASIAN	CAUCASIAN		This sample has been isolated from an organism whose ethnicity is caucasian
