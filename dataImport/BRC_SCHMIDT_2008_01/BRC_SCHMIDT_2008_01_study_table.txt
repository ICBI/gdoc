BRC_SCHMIDT_2008_01	The Humoral Immune System Has a Key Prognostic Impact in Node-Negative Breast Cancer	"Estrogen receptor (ER) expression and proliferative activity are established prognostic factors in breast cancer. In a search for additional prognostic motives we analyzed the gene expression patterns of 200 tumors of patients who were not treated by systemic therapy after surgery using a discovery approach. After performing hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified co-regulated genes related to the biological process of proliferation, steroid hormone receptor expression, as well as B cell and T cell infiltration. We calculated metagenes as surrogate for all genes contained within a particular cluster and visualized the relative expression in relation to time to metastasis with principal component analysis. Distinct patterns led to the hypothesis of a prognostic role of the immune system in tumors with high expression of proliferation associated genes.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE11121">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE11121</a>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18593943">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18593943</a>	BREAST	Sample iid	1	PUBLIC	BRC_SCHMIDT_2008_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
