CRC_SELGA_2008_02	Transcriptional regulation of aldo-keto reductase 1C1 in human colon cancer cells resistant to methotrexate	Two cell lines are compared in the study, which are HT29 colon cancer cells sensitive to methotrexate and HT29 cells resistant to 10e-5M methotrexate. While studying differentially expressed genes between sensitive and 10-5 M Methotrexate (MTX) resistant HT29 human colon cancer cells, we identified some members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. The study was followed with the member AKR1C1 (EC 1.1.1.213), validating its increase in mRNA and protein levels in MTX resistant cells. The genomic content for AKR1C1 remained unchanged between sensitive and resistant cells, thereby excluding a mechanism of AKR1C1 gene amplification. Thus, we cloned the AKR1C1 human promoter and performed luciferase experiments that revealed a transcriptional regulation of the gene in the resistant cells. Computational studies showed a putative binding site for the transcription factor Sp1. The co-transfection of Sp1 or Sp3 with different constructs of AKR1C1 promoter deletions, including and excluding the proximal GC-box, demonstrated a key role for these factors in regulating AKR1C1 transcriptional activity.<br><br> Link to GEO: <a href=" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE9412"> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE9412</a> <br> Link to Pubmed: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17945194">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17945194</a> <br>Link to ATCC: <a href="http://www.atcc.org/ATCCAdvancedCatalogSearch/ProductDetails/tabid/452/Default.aspx?ATCCNum=HTB-38&Template=cellBiology">http://www.atcc.org/ATCCAdvancedCatalogSearch/ProductDetails/tabid/452/Default.aspx?ATCCNum=HTB-38&Template=cellBiology</a> <br> <br>Method of hybridization: Human Genome U133A 2.0 from  Affymetrix <br> Media and Supplements:Human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 was routinely grown in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 degree Celsius in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere	COLON CANCER	Sample ID	1	PUBLIC	CRC_SELGA_2008_02	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1,1
