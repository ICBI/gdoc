TYPE	TERM	TERM_MEANING	EVS_ID	DFINITIONMETHOTREXATE_SENSITIVITY	SENSITIVE	SENSITIVE		Indictes that the sample is sensitive to Methotrexate  METHOTREXATE_SENSITIVITY	RESISTANT	RESISTANT		Indictes that the sample is resistant to Methotrexate  ALTERNATE_NAME	HTB-38	HTB-38		The alternate name for HT29 cell line is HTB-38SOURCE	COLON CANCER	COLON CANCER		This sample has been isolated from a colon cancer cellGROWTH_PROPERTIES	ADHERENT	ADHERENT		"This sample has an adherent growth property. Adherent cells require a surface, such as tissue culture plastic or microcarrier, which may be coated with extracellular matrix components to increase adhesion properties and provide other signals needed for growth and differentiation. Most cells derived from solid tissues are adherent."ORGANISM	HUMAN	HUMAN		This sample has been isolated from the human speciesMORPHOLOGY	EPITHELIAL	EPITHELIAL		"This sample has cells with Epithelial-like morphology. Epithelial-like cells are polygonal in shape with more regular dimensions, and grow attached to a substrate in discrete patches."GENDER	FEMALE	FEMALE		This sample has been isolated from an organism whose gender is femaleRACE	CAUCASIAN	CAUCASIAN		This sample has been isolated from an organism whose ethnicity is caucasianBLOOD_TYPE	A	A		Indicates that this sample is of blood type ARH_TYPE	RH+	RH+		Indicates that this sample is Rh positiveHLA_PROFILE	A1||A3||B12||B17||CW5	A1||A3||B12||B17||CW5		A1||A3||B12||B17||CW5ISOLATION_DATE	1964	1964		The sample was isolaetd in 1964TUMORIGENIC	YES	YES		The sample is capable of forming tumorsER_STATUS	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE		Estrogen Receptor negativeER_STATUS	POSITIVE	POSITIVE		Estrogen Receptor positivePGR_STATUS	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE		Progesteron Receptor negativePGR_STATUS	POSITIVE	POSITIVE		Progesteron Receptor positiveMYC_STATUS	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE		Protein MYC negativeMYC_STATUS	POSITIVE	POSITIVE		Protein MYC positiveRAS_STATUS	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE		Protein RAS negativeRAS_STATUS	POSITIVE	POSITIVE		Protein RAS positiveMTB_STATUS	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE		Protein MTB negativeMTB_STATUS	POSITIVE	POSITIVE		Protein MTB positiveFOS_STATUS	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE		Protein FOS negativeFOS_STATUS	POSITIVE	POSITIVE		Protein FOS positiveSIS_STATUS	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE		Protein SIS negativeSIS_STATUS	POSITIVE	POSITIVE		Protein SIS positiveP53_STATUS	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE		Protein P53 negativeP53_STATUS	POSITIVE	POSITIVE		Protein P53 positiveABL_STATUS	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE		Protein ABL negativeABL_STATUS	POSITIVE	POSITIVE		Protein ABL positiveROS_STATUS	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE		Protein ROS negativeROS_STATUS	POSITIVE	POSITIVE		Protein ROS positiveSRC_STATUS	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE		Protein SRC negativeSRC_STATUS	POSITIVE	POSITIVE		Protein SRC positive
