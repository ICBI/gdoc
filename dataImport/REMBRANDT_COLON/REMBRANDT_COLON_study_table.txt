It contains 390 Affy expression files (HG-U133A). RNA expression data was generated as part of a colon cancer study. Samples were obtained from patients, including primary colon cancer, polyps, metastases, and matched normal mucosa (obtained from the margins of the resection). The RNA was extracted from tissue samples obtained from resections and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 arrays.<br> <br> Link to experiment in Array Express: <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3073/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3073/</a><br>	COLON CANCER	Sample id	1	PUBLIC	REMBRANDT_COLON	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1	0	1	0
