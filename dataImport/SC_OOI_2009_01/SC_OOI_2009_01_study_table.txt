SC_OOI_2009_01	Gastric Cancer Project '08 (Singapore Patient Cohort)	Genome-wide mRNA expression profiles of 200 primary gastric tumors from the Singapore patient cohort. Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of global cancer mortality, with individual gastric tumors displaying significant heterogeneity in their deregulation of various oncogenic pathways. We aim to identify major oncogenic pathways in GC that robustly impact patient survival and treatment response. We used an in silico strategy based on gene expression signatures and connectivity analytics to map patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in 25 unique GC cell lines, and in 301 primary gastric cancers from three independent patient cohorts. Of 11 oncogenic pathways previously implicated in GC, we identified three predominant pathways (proliferation/stem cell, NF-kB, and Wnt/b-catenin) deregulated in the majority (>70%) of gastric tumors. Using a variety of proliferative, Wnt, and NF-kB-related assays, we experimentally validated the pathway predictions in multiple GC cell lines showing similar pathway activation patterns in vitro. Patients stratified at the level of individual pathways did not exhibit consistent differences in clinical outcome. However, patients grouped by oncogenic pathway combinations demonstrated robust and significant survival differences (e.g., high proliferation/high NF-kB vs. low proliferation/low NF-kB), suggesting that tumor behavior in GC is likely influenced by the combined effects of multiple oncogenic pathways. Our results demonstrate that GCs can be successfully taxonomized by oncogenic pathway activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE15459">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE15459 </a>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19798449">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19798449</a>  	N/A	Sample iid	1	PUBLIC	SC_OOI_2009_01	1	CLINIC, MICROARRAY	1, 1
