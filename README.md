# G-DOC

The Georgetown Database of Cancer is a precision medicine platform containing molecular and clinical data from thousands of patients and cell lines, along with tools for analysis and data visualization. 
The platform enables the integrative analysis of multiple data types to understand disease mechanisms. G-DOC has three overlapping entry points for the user based on their interests: 1) Personalized Medicine, 2) Translational Research, and 3) Population Genetics. 

The Precision Medicine workflow integrates molecular and clinical research data with patient data and outcomes with patient as the central focus. The Translational Research workflow conducts multi-omic analysis of clinical samples, cell lines and animal models to discover new markers and explore connections between them and with clinical outcomes. Users can explore genetic variation across different populations, and understand how SNP frequencies impact drug metabolism through the Population Genetics workflow
